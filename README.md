# Game-website
This was my first coursework in year 2 studying Information technology. I really enjoyed creating websites in the CST2120 Web Development module.
I got 83/100 for this project, it was to create a website using html css and javascript and to integerate a game of our choice into our website.
We also had to make sure to add a login and register page were it's stored on local storage.
